## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive calendar year revenue analysis for the oil and gas sector, leveraging SQL for data processing and in-depth analytical insights. The analysis focuses on understanding historical revenue trends, identifying key performance drivers across various dimensions (states, products, revenue types, commodities, land classes, and counties), and forecasting future revenue. The aim is to transform raw financial data into actionable intelligence, supporting strategic decision-making and optimizing business operations within the industry.

## Problem Statement
The oil and gas industry often grapples with fluctuating market dynamics, complex revenue streams, and the need for data-driven insights to maintain profitability and ensure sustainable growth. Without a clear understanding of historical performance, key revenue contributors, and future projections, stakeholders face challenges in optimizing resource allocation, identifying diversification opportunities, and making informed strategic decisions, leading to potential revenue loss or missed growth opportunities.

## Project Objective
The primary objectives of this project are to:

* **Enhance Data Clarity and Reliability:** Implement robust data preprocessing techniques (e.g., handling NULL values, removing irrelevant columns) to ensure clean, accurate, and interpretable revenue datasets.

* **Identify Key Revenue Drivers:** Analyze revenue contributions across diverse dimensions such as states, products, revenue types, commodities, land classes, and counties to pinpoint major financial contributors and areas for strategic focus.

* **Uncover Historical Trends and Patterns:** Calculate total and average annual revenues, analyze year-over-year growth rates, and assess revenue distribution to understand past performance and identify significant trends.

* **Provide Future Revenue Projections:** Develop forecasting models (e.g., 3-year moving average, linear trend analysis) to predict future revenue, thereby aiding in proactive strategic planning, cost optimization, and risk mitigation.

* **Support Informed Decision-Making:** Deliver actionable insights that empower stakeholders to optimize resource allocation, identify growth and diversification opportunities, and make data-driven decisions to enhance overall financial performance in the oil and gas sector.

## Analysis
First, we observed that certain columns in our dataset had NULL values, which were expected based on the nature of the data (e.g., onshore revenue fields being empty for offshore records and vice versa). To make the dataset cleaner and more interpretable, we replaced all these NULL values with "N/A" using the COALESCE function. This ensured that the data remains clear without any ambiguous blanks.
We applied this update to several columns, including:

 - Calendar Year

 - Land Class

 - Land Category

 - State

 - County

 - Offshore Region

 - Revenue Type

 - Mineral Lease Type

 - Commodity

 - Product

This preprocessing step improves readability and clarity for analysis, as it provides consistent placeholders in the dataset.


Next we removed the FIPS_Code column from the calendar_year_rev table using the DROP COLUMN command. This step simplifies our dataset by eliminating a field that is not relevant to the analysis, helping us focus on the most useful data.


We then calculated the Total Revenue from the calendar_year_rev table using the SUM function. By applying the ROUND function, we ensured the result is neatly formatted to two decimal places. This gives us a precise and presentable summary of the overall revenue generated. 

The Total Revenue calculated from the calendar_year_rev table comes out to 249,993,233,733.29. This provides us with a clear overview of the immense scale of revenue across all calendar years.


We calculated the Average Annual Revenue by first grouping the data by Calendar_Year to determine the Annual Revenue for each year. Then, we computed the average of these annual values using the AVG function and rounded the result to two decimal places for clarity.

The resulting Average Annual Revenue is 11,904,439,701.59. This provides a significant insight into the overall revenue trend across the years.


For our next analysis, analyzing total revenue by different features, we're diving deeper to uncover how various factors contribute to the overall revenue. The goal here is to provide stakeholders with a granular view of the revenue breakdown, enabling them to better understand which areas, categories, or attributes are driving revenue. This, in turn, can inform strategic decisions, identify key opportunities, and highlight any underperforming segments.

For example:

Analyzing total revenue by land class (onshore vs. offshore) can reveal how much revenue comes from different land types.

Looking at revenue by state might show which regions are contributing the most, allowing for resource allocation and investment decisions.

Exploring revenue by commodity or product can identify the most profitable items and potential areas for diversification.

This kind of breakdown helps stakeholders connect the data to the broader business strategy. It’s all about painting a clearer picture of where the revenue is coming from and why it matters.

### Insights:
**Revenue Stability**:

 - The moving average smooths out fluctuations, providing a clearer view of revenue trends. For example, from 2013 to 2014, the moving average consistently reflects stable revenue near the 13 billion mark, showing a period of steady growth.

**Sharp Revenue Peaks**:

 - 2022 exhibits a sharp peak in both total revenue (23.91 billion) and moving average (13.98 billion). This suggests a significant uptick that may correlate with external factors or successful industry initiatives.

**Post-Peak Growth**:

 - The moving average continues to rise in 2023, reaching 17.51 billion, reflecting the lingering effects of the revenue surge in 2022.

**Periods of Decline**:

 - During years like 2015 to 2017, the moving average shows a downward trend from 11.69 billion to 7.24 billion, indicating a sustained dip in financial performance. This period warrants investigation to uncover potential challenges.

**Strategic Applications**:

 - The moving average highlights years of strong performance (e.g., 2008, 2022) and years of decline (e.g., 2015–2017). These insights help in identifying successful strategies or mitigating factors for underperforming periods.

This analysis presents a comprehensive view of revenue trends over time, smoothing out annual fluctuations and highlighting strategic opportunities.


## Linear Trend Analysis

**Objective**: The Linear Trend Analysis seeks to determine the relationship between revenue and time and to forecast future revenue based on this trend. By calculating a linear regression line, we derive a slope and intercept to predict revenue for the next year.

**Methodology**:
**Revenue Aggregation**:

 - Revenue data is grouped by Calendar_Year, calculating the total revenue for each year using a Common Table Expression (CTE).

**Indexing Years**:

 - A new column Year_Index is created to assign a sequential number to each year, enabling numerical operations for linear trend calculation.

**Trend Coefficients**:

 - Using statistical formulas for linear regression, the slope (m) and intercept (b) of the trend line are calculated:

 -- Slope (m): Represents the rate of change in revenue over years.

 -- Intercept (b): Reflects the predicted revenue when the year index is zero.

**Forecasting**:

 - The next year is predicted by applying the linear trend formula:

## Purpose:
This analysis aims to:

 - Understand the historical trends in revenue over time.

 - Provide a forecast for the next year's revenue based on a linear trend.

 - Support stakeholders in strategic planning and decision-making.


| Predicted Year | Predicted Revenue  |
|----------------|--------------------|
| 2024           | 13222987340.35    |


### Insights:
**Predicted Revenue for 2024**:

 - Based on the linear trend analysis, the predicted revenue for 2024 is approximately 13.22 billion. This forecast reflects the historical trends and provides a data-driven estimate of financial performance.

**Trend Implications**:

 - The predicted revenue shows a decline compared to the peak years like 2022 and 2023. This suggests a potential leveling or slight reduction in revenue growth over time.

**Strategic Planning**:

 - The trend can guide stakeholders in preparing for the predicted revenue levels. This might involve focusing on cost optimization, diversifying revenue streams, or increasing efficiency to maximize profitability.

**Comparison with Moving Average**:

 - The moving average for recent years suggests slightly higher revenue trends than this linear forecast. Comparing these models can help refine forecasts by accounting for different perspectives on historical data.
