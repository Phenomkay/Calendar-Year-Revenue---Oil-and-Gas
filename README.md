First, we observed that certain columns in our dataset had NULL values, which were expected based on the nature of the data (e.g., onshore revenue fields being empty for offshore records and vice versa). To make the dataset cleaner and more interpretable, we replaced all these NULL values with "N/A" using the COALESCE function. This ensured that the data remains clear without any ambiguous blanks.
We applied this update to several columns, including:

 - Calendar Year

 - Land Class

 - Land Category

 - State

 - County

 - Offshore Region

 - Revenue Type

 - Mineral Lease Type

 - Commodity

 - Product

This preprocessing step improves readability and clarity for analysis, as it provides consistent placeholders in the dataset.


Next we removed the FIPS_Code column from the calendar_year_rev table using the DROP COLUMN command. This step simplifies our dataset by eliminating a field that is not relevant to the analysis, helping us focus on the most useful data.


We then calculated the Total Revenue from the calendar_year_rev table using the SUM function. By applying the ROUND function, we ensured the result is neatly formatted to two decimal places. This gives us a precise and presentable summary of the overall revenue generated. 

The Total Revenue calculated from the calendar_year_rev table comes out to 249,993,233,733.29. This provides us with a clear overview of the immense scale of revenue across all calendar years.


We calculated the Average Annual Revenue by first grouping the data by Calendar_Year to determine the Annual Revenue for each year. Then, we computed the average of these annual values using the AVG function and rounded the result to two decimal places for clarity.

The resulting Average Annual Revenue is 11,904,439,701.59. This provides a significant insight into the overall revenue trend across the years.


For our next analysis, analyzing total revenue by different features, we're diving deeper to uncover how various factors contribute to the overall revenue. The goal here is to provide stakeholders with a granular view of the revenue breakdown, enabling them to better understand which areas, categories, or attributes are driving revenue. This, in turn, can inform strategic decisions, identify key opportunities, and highlight any underperforming segments.

For example:

Analyzing total revenue by land class (onshore vs. offshore) can reveal how much revenue comes from different land types.

Looking at revenue by state might show which regions are contributing the most, allowing for resource allocation and investment decisions.

Exploring revenue by commodity or product can identify the most profitable items and potential areas for diversification.

This kind of breakdown helps stakeholders connect the data to the broader business strategy. Itâ€™s all about painting a clearer picture of where the revenue is coming from and why it matters.


## Revenue Contribution by State: Analysis Summary

Here, we examined the contribution of revenue by state to identify the key geographic drivers of total revenue.

**Objective**: To evaluate the total revenue generated by each state and calculate their percentage contribution to the overall revenue. This analysis aims to highlight top-performing states and provide a comparative view of their financial impact.

**Methodology**: 
 - **Total Revenue Calculation**: Using SQL, we summed up the revenue for each state from the dataset.

 - **Percentage Contribution**: For each state, we calculated the proportion of its revenue relative to the total revenue across all states. The percentage values were rounded to two decimal places for accuracy.

 - **Sorting**: States were ranked in descending order of total revenue to easily identify top contributors.

**Expected Insights**:

 - A clear ranking of states based on their total revenue contributions.

 - Identification of states with significant revenue percentages, which can guide decision-making in resource allocation and strategy formulation.

 - A foundation for understanding regional patterns and opportunities.

This analysis provides stakeholders with a strategic view of state-level contributions to revenue, facilitating more informed geographic or policy decisions. Once the results are available, we can further interpret and present actionable insights.

### Key Insights
1. **Revenue Concentration**:
A significant portion of the total revenue 63.21% comes from records categorized as N/A. This suggests a large contribution from data that are not associated with a specific state. This represents offshore revenues, which warrants further investigation to understand its importance.

The top three contributing states (New Mexico, Wyoming, and Colorado) collectively account for 30.22% of the revenue, showcasing the dominance of these regions in oil and gas revenue generation.

2. **Top Performing States**:
New Mexico leads with 14.07%, followed closely by Wyoming with 13.87%, and Colorado at 2.28%. These states are critical drivers of total revenue and likely hold strategic importance for the industry.

3. **Low Revenue Contributors**:
Several states, such as Georgia, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, show negligible contributions (0.00%), indicating minimal or no activity in these regions concerning oil and gas production. This highlights regions with potential for further exploration or investment, if feasible.

4. **Regional Patterns**:
States with significant oil and gas production, such as Texas and Louisiana, surprisingly contribute smaller percentages (0.21% and 0.19%, respectively). This could be due to missing data, outdated records, or differences in classification methods.

5. **Strategic Opportunities**:
Understanding why certain states like New Mexico and Wyoming perform exceptionally well could provide insights into replicating their success in other regions.

For states with negligible revenue, it may be worth exploring whether geological limitations or untapped potential are the reasons behind their low contributions.

These insights set the stage for deeper exploration of regional dynamics and the factors influencing revenue generation across states.


## Revenue contribution by product

Analyzing revenue contribution by product is a crucial step that provides insight into the financial impact of various oil and gas products. Here's what we accomplished:

**Summing Revenue by Product**:

 - It calculates the total revenue for each product using the SUM function.

**Calculating Percentage Contribution**:

 - For each product, it determines the proportion of its revenue relative to the total revenue across all products. This percentage is rounded to two decimal places for clarity.

**Ranking Products**:

 - Products are ranked in descending order based on their total revenue contribution, allowing us to easily identify the most and least profitable products.

### Purpose of This Analysis:
This step is designed to pinpoint which products generate the highest revenue and assess their relative contributions. It can help stakeholders:

Identify the most lucrative products for prioritization and investment.

Highlight underperforming products that may need further exploration, marketing, or adjustment.

Establish a basis for strategic decisions around product development and diversification.
