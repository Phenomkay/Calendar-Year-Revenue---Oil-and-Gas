First, we observed that certain columns in our dataset had NULL values, which were expected based on the nature of the data (e.g., onshore revenue fields being empty for offshore records and vice versa). To make the dataset cleaner and more interpretable, we replaced all these NULL values with "N/A" using the COALESCE function. This ensured that the data remains clear without any ambiguous blanks.
We applied this update to several columns, including:

 - Calendar Year

 - Land Class

 - Land Category

 - State

 - County

 - Offshore Region

 - Revenue Type

 - Mineral Lease Type

 - Commodity

 - Product

This preprocessing step improves readability and clarity for analysis, as it provides consistent placeholders in the dataset.


Next we removed the FIPS_Code column from the calendar_year_rev table using the DROP COLUMN command. This step simplifies our dataset by eliminating a field that is not relevant to the analysis, helping us focus on the most useful data.


We then calculated the Total Revenue from the calendar_year_rev table using the SUM function. By applying the ROUND function, we ensured the result is neatly formatted to two decimal places. This gives us a precise and presentable summary of the overall revenue generated. 

The Total Revenue calculated from the calendar_year_rev table comes out to 249,993,233,733.29. This provides us with a clear overview of the immense scale of revenue across all calendar years.


We calculated the Average Annual Revenue by first grouping the data by Calendar_Year to determine the Annual Revenue for each year. Then, we computed the average of these annual values using the AVG function and rounded the result to two decimal places for clarity.

The resulting Average Annual Revenue is 11,904,439,701.59. This provides a significant insight into the overall revenue trend across the years.


For our next analysis, analyzing total revenue by different features, we're diving deeper to uncover how various factors contribute to the overall revenue. The goal here is to provide stakeholders with a granular view of the revenue breakdown, enabling them to better understand which areas, categories, or attributes are driving revenue. This, in turn, can inform strategic decisions, identify key opportunities, and highlight any underperforming segments.

For example:

Analyzing total revenue by land class (onshore vs. offshore) can reveal how much revenue comes from different land types.

Looking at revenue by state might show which regions are contributing the most, allowing for resource allocation and investment decisions.

Exploring revenue by commodity or product can identify the most profitable items and potential areas for diversification.

This kind of breakdown helps stakeholders connect the data to the broader business strategy. Itâ€™s all about painting a clearer picture of where the revenue is coming from and why it matters.
